Code base for evaluating predicted error of survival from listing models. The Build_ORGAN_SurvivalFromListing.R files clean the data, complete multiple imputation, and estimate the survival from listing models, including the models for estimating the predicted error. These files require updating the primary directory, i.e., the root object defined at the top of the files. The models rely on the internal SRTR Standard Analytical File (SAF). The SAS files export the SAFs into comma separated files and require updating the directory information for the location of the SAF.
